# Contributing to HUB-Buddy

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Getting Started

1. Check out our open issues on GitHub
2. Comment on an issue to explain why you're eligible to work on it, mentioning your experience and skills

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Picking an Issue**: Select an open issue and provide details about your qualifications in the comments
- **Code Style**: Use Biome for auto-formatting. Ensure Biome is set as your default formatter in your IDE
- Install the [Biome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork & Clone**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HUB-Buddy.git
cd HUB-Buddy
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
bun install
```

3. **Development Setup**

**Option A: Docker (Recommended for beginners)**
```bash
# Navigate to backend and start with Docker
cd apps/backend
docker-compose up

# Test that it's working
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Option B: Local Development**
```bash
# Setup environment variables
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env

# Start development
bun run dev
```

4. **Create a Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

5. **Make Changes & Format**
```bash
# Make your changes...
bun run format:fix  # Auto-fixes formatting
```

6. **Create Pull Request**
- Add a description (any length is fine!)
- Our CI will handle the rest

## 🐳 Docker Development (Recommended)

For easier onboarding, we provide a **simple Docker setup** especially for the backend:

### Quick Docker Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HUB-Buddy.git
cd HUB-Buddy/apps/backend

# 2. Create .env file (minimal setup for Docker)
echo "PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/hubbuddy
JWT_SECRET=test_jwt_secret_for_docker_testing
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development" > .env

# 3. Start Docker containers
docker-compose up

# 4. Test the API
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### Docker Benefits for Contributors

- ✅ **No local setup needed**: Works out of the box
- ✅ **Environment consistency**: Same setup for everyone
- ✅ **Hot reload**: Code changes automatically restart the server
- ✅ **Health monitoring**: Built-in health checks
- ✅ **Easy cleanup**: `docker-compose down` removes everything

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d

# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Restart after changes
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Working with Docker

- **Edit code normally**: Changes sync automatically with the container
- **Install new packages**: Restart container after adding dependencies
- **Database changes**: Migrations run automatically on startup
- **Debugging**: Use `docker-compose logs backend` to see server logs

## ✅ Automated Quality Checks

Our CI/CD is designed to be **contributor-friendly** while maintaining code quality:

- **Code Formatting**: Auto-formatted with Biome
- **Build Validation**: Ensures your changes don't break anything
- **Security**: Basic check for exposed secrets
- **Smart Testing**: Only tests the apps you modify (faster CI)
- **Large PR Warning**: Friendly reminder for large changes (doesn't block merge)

### 🎯 Contributor-Friendly Features

- **Auto-formatting**: Code gets formatted automatically
- **No strict commit rules**: Write commits however you prefer (though conventional commits are encouraged)
- **No required labels**: We don't enforce labels on PRs
- **Draft PRs**: Skip validation until you're ready
- **Warnings vs Errors**: Most issues are warnings, not blockers

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Format code automatically
bun run format:fix

# Check formatting
bun run format

# Build all apps
bun run build

# Start development
bun run dev

# Run tests
bun run test
```

## Git Conventions

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Best Practices

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single, complete change
   - One logical change per commit
   - Don't mix different types of changes
   - Keep commits focused and small

2. **Commit Message Structure**:
   - First line: type and short description (max 72 characters)
   - Body: detailed explanation if needed
   - Footer: references to issues/tickets if applicable

3. **When to Commit**:
   - After completing a logical unit of work
   - When the code is in a working state
   - Before making a different type of change

### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or tooling changes
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits

For breaking changes, append `!` after the type/scope.

### Examples

```bash
# Good: Atomic commit with single change
feat: add user authentication

# Good: Atomic commit with scope
feat(auth): implement JWT token validation

# Bad: Multiple changes in one commit
feat: add auth and fix login bug and update docs

# Good: Breaking change
feat!: migrate to new API version
```

### Branch Naming

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `feature/` | New features |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `hotfix/` | Critical fixes |
| `docs/` | Documentation |
| `test/` | Testing |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring |
| `chore/` | Maintenance |

Example:
```bash
feature/add-community-dashboard
fix/login-validation-error
docs/update-api-documentation
```

## Process for Submitting a PR

1. **Create a new branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes and commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature name"
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

3. **Create a pull request on GitHub**
   - Check for conflicts and resolve them
   - Provide a summary of the changes you have made
   - Add reviewers if needed
   - Wait for the reviewers to review your PR

## 🤝 What We Need vs What We Don't

### What We Need
- **Description**: Tell us what you changed and why
- **Working code**: Should build without errors

### What We Don't Require
- Perfect commit message format (conventional commits encouraged but not enforced by CI)
- Labels on PRs
- Detailed descriptions (brief is fine!)
- Perfect code style (we auto-format)

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Formatting issues?** Run `bun run format:fix`
- **Build errors?** Check the CI logs for specific errors
- **Large PR warning?** Consider splitting into smaller PRs (but it won't block merge)
- **Questions?** Open an issue or ask in your PR

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
bun run test:coverage
```

## Code Review Process

1. Submit your PR with a clear description
2. Automated checks will run (linting, tests, build)
3. A maintainer will review your code
4. Address any requested changes
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged!
